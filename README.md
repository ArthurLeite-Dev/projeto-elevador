## 📝 About the Project:
This project simulates the logic and movement of an elevator system. The main goal was to apply and strengthen my knowledge of the "Big Three" of front-end development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), focusing on DOM manipulation.

## Technologies Used:
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Styling and transitions for smooth movements.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core logic, event handling, and state management.

## Key Features Learned:
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating the interface based on user input.
* **Event Handling:** Managing multiple button clicks and elevator queues.
* **CSS Transitions:** Creating realistic movement animations.
* **Problem Solving:** Translating real-world logic (elevator physics/rules) into clean code.
